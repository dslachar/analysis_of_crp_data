    "Since the mid-1980s the amount spent on political elections by campaigns and outside groups, measured by the Federal Election Committee, has grown by 555 percent nationwide. While voting ultimately determines the result of any given election, analyzing political contributions can signal how passionate and invested individuals are in the success of a given candidate. In this report we will assess the political climate in Colorado through focusing on individual campaign finance contributions from 1992 through 2016.  "

While once a solidly conservative state, Colorado’s changing culture and influx of new residents from other regions has shifted Colorado’s politics more progressive.

However, since the late 2000's through 2013, Democrats have controlled both houses in addition to the Governer's seat. \n",

The first step in our data cleaning process was to convert the datafiles into a more compact form to allow us to upload all the data into our GitHub repository. We decided to convert the data text files into pickle files. Since each campaign year contained the same four datafiles, we created four functions in our CleanUP.py code, to read in the corresponding text files into a pandas data frame to clean up and then convert the cleaned data frame into a pickle file. When reading in each text file to convert to a data frame, we had to generate our own delimiter since the text files were not separated by commas."
