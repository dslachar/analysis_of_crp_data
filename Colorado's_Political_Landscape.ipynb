    "Since the mid-1980s the amount spent on political elections by campaigns and outside groups, measured by the Federal Election Committee, has grown by 555 percent nationwide. While voting ultimately determines the result of any given election, analyzing political contributions can signal how passionate and invested individuals are in the success of a given candidate. In this report we will assess the political climate in Colorado through focusing on individual campaign finance contributions from 1992 through 2016.  "
